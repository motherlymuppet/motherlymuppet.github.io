I was recently invited to NE:Tech to give a 15-minute talk on solving minesweeper.
It wasn't what I (nor anyone else) expected, but I'm really happy with how it went.
In the future, I hope to give some more traditional tech talks, and there's definitely things in the pipeline.
Keep an eye out!

The full talk is available via youtube:

The website used during the talk is [available online](http://minesweeper.stevenwaterman.uk) and is [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/stevenwaterman/Minesweeper-Constrained)

I'd love for you to get in touch with any questions or comments!
