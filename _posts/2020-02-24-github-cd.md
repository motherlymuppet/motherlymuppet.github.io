For my latest blog post, I tried something different and created an interactive visualisation.
I designed it from the ground-up to work with the Scott Logic blog, and it won't work on this site.
Therefore, you'll have to [read it on the SL blog](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/02/24/github-cd.html) instead!
