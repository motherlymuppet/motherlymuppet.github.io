In a follow-up to my [recent blog post](http://www.stevenwaterman.uk/2020/02/17/minesweeper-optimisation.html), I gave a tech talk discussing my experience optimising Svelte.
It was good fun, and pretty chill - not the most technical talk, but I'm glad I got to present it!

The full talk is available via youtube:
