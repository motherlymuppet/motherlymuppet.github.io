This post is quite delayed, but I only just got ahold of the video!
Just before Christmas, I gave my first ever tech talk internally at Scott Logic.
It (attempts to) explain how to solve minesweeper, while solving minesweeper, with a 3 minute time limit.
If you have seen my [second talk on minesweeper](http://www.stevenwaterman.uk/2020/01/13/solving-minesweeper-polynomial.html), you'll probably aleady know everything that I discuss - but I hope it's fun anyway!

The full talk is available via youtube:

[The slides are also available in PDF form](http://www.stevenwaterman.uk/assets/slides/how-to-solve-minesweeper-in-3-mins.pdf)
